  <h2>Brave New World</h2>
  <p>For some it's fiction. For others it's an action plan.</p>

  <h3>Episodes 1 and 2</h3>
  <p>Everyone's a drug addict. Soma suppresses unpleasant feelings.</p>

  <p>In a perfect world, everyone is happy. And if not, take a pill.</p>

  <p>
    People, like in the real world, are divided into classes. The smartest and
    most influential are alphas. The simply smart are betas, and so on.
  </p>

  <p>
    At the very bottom are we all, 99% of the population, epsilons. For us are
    all these movies, TV shows, fairy tales, stories. Anything but thinking
    about what's really important in this life.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sex is a duty. And you can't be selfish. Everyone must have a chance to be
    with you for their pleasure.
  </p>

  <p>
    The connected video communication system is available to all. Anyone can see
    everything you see. No privacy.
  </p>

  <p>
    Deprive a person of personal space, privacy, personal life. What do we get
    then? A cog for the system. But then the question. What does sex have to do
    with it? Where have you seen a cog with a penis or vagina? It's some kind of
    unpleasant cog. You can't screw it in or out.
  </p>

  <p>
    She's a beta. Beta plus. She's lower in rank. She knows her place. Any alpha
    can use her, and she's happy to help them with this.
  </p>

  <p>
    Children without parents. They are raised in an incubator. Strict educators
    walk around with electric sticks and shock children even for the smallest
    offense.
  </p>

  <p>
    The degree of civilization of a person is in how dependent they are on other
    people, technology, scientific achievements.
  </p>

  <p>
    A journey to a third world country. Such an amusement park with savages.
    They're even lower than epsilons. They don't have soma. But they have beer.
    Does it remind you of anything?
  </p>

  <p>
    There people are born naturally. They get angry, they can feel. There, no
    one is forced to be happy.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can stay there forever if you have the courage. One stayed. Had a son.
    And could no longer return. Because the word "mom" in the new world is a
    curse word.
  </p>

  <h3>Episodes 3 and 4</h3>
  <p>
    Savages and the forced savage freely possess weapons and medical skills to
    extract bullets from shot comrades.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why if a woman or girl uses her attractiveness for gain is it not considered
    sexual harassment? Because both win. But if a man uses sex for his benefit,
    the girl considers herself a victim. Why?
  </p>

  <p>
    So out of kindness of heart, you decide to help people and then because of
    this you get into such trouble that you start to regret it.
  </p>

  <p>
    What are you willing to do to bring back the good old times? To get what you
    want you need to give up what you already have.
  </p>

  <p>
    How I dislike the phrase "welcome to the real world". What does it mean?
    That the world is cruel. That justice doesn't exist. Until now you lived in
    a world of illusions, and now they're destroyed, and you see the world as it
    really is. Nonsense. The world is what you want or don't want to see it as.
    If someone sees it differently doesn't mean you have your head in the
    clouds. With this phrase, they're inviting you to look at the world through
    their eyes.
  </p>

  <h3>Episodes 5 and 6</h3>
  <p>
    She liked feeling emotions, she liked controlling the process, she's a beta
    plus, he's an alpha plus, different levels, but this time the initiative was
    in her hands. And did he like it? To lose control for a few moments like
    that. Maybe yes, maybe no. But the very fact that he thought about it
    indicates that those principles they were taught since childhood are not so
    unshakeable.
  </p>

  <p>
    A pill to wake up, a pill to concentrate on work, a pill to restore strength
    after work, a pill to relax, a pill to have fun, a pill for sex or instead
    of sex, a pill to fall asleep. A pill to live in such a world. A pill to not
    feel bad emotions or forget bad memories. How convenient, one pill for
    everything, or several special pills.
  </p>

  <p>Playing not for fun, but for victory. Without pills. Playing tennis.</p>

  <h3>Episodes 7 and 8</h3>
  <p>
    The savage so aggressively protects his private life, but his arguments
    become weaker. Gets more and more used to comfort. Is it really necessary to
    completely and voluntarily deprive yourself of private life to become
    civilized? Everything open. No secrets, no closed doors. Everyone knows
    everything about everyone. Or can easily find out.
  </p>

  <p>
    In a perfect world, emotions are a commodity that can be obtained at any
    party. Your own emotions are suppressed. To feel something other than
    unlimited happiness, you need to receive a specially prepared product.
  </p>

  <h3>Episode 9 End</h3>
  <p>
    A revolution needs a leader. One whom the crowd will follow. But what if you
    didn't want to be at the head of the revolution? What if these were just
    words of a drunk person, heard by someone not very smart and understood
    somehow wrong?
  </p>

  <p>Do you want to be happy? Or do you want to be free?</p>

  <p>
    The clicking of the pill dispenser irritates even more than the reason why
    they got it out. Especially when there are many nervous people around. And
    they click almost after every word.
  </p>

  <p>
    Could all their civilization really have been held together only by these
    pills? As soon as the source of pills ran out, they turned into savages, but
    not those in the amusement park where our savage is from, but those savages
    who lived in the Stone Age.
  </p>

  <p>
    What to do if you've lost the meaning of life? Not only meaning but the
    familiar world has collapsed. How to live on? Is it worth living on? What
    should those who never had this meaning do? And the order that was in effect
    until now wasn't quite satisfactory. Or not satisfactory at all.
  </p>

  <p>
    You need to stop, stop your movement. And most importantly, stop your
    thoughts. Stop grinding these useless thoughts in a vicious circle and look
    around. While you're alive you have the opportunity to realize yourself.
    Suicide is not the way out. No matter how romantic artistic creators of the
    past and present made it. Like in the movie Fight Club or the work of
    performer Lana Del Rey.
  </p>

  <p>Some people can't be killed. Because they're not living anyway.</p>

  <p>Are you living? Am I living?</p>
